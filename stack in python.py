"""Rajiv has created a dictionary containing employee names and their salaries as
key value pairs of 6 employees.
Write a program, with separate user defined functions to perform the following operations:
Push the keys (employee name) of the dictionary into a stack, where the
corresponding value (salary) is less than 85000.
‚óè Pop and display the content of the stack.
For example:
If the sample content of the dictionary is as follows:
Emp={"Ajay":76000, "Jyothi":150000, "David":89000, "Remya":65000,
"Karthika":90000, "Vijay":82000}
The output from the program should be:
Vijay Remya Ajay"""
